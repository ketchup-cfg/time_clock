# time_clock
This was a program that I helped write for my jBASE class as our final project that was shown to a local employer during a presentation.

GitHub, for some reason, thinks that this was written in Brainfuck, but it was written in jBASIC, a programming language similar to BASIC and derived from the Pick/BASIC programming language for use with the jBASE MultiValue database system. The only file in here with actual code is the
[TIMEENTRY.b](https://github.com/realcooltrev/Time-Clock/blob/master/TIMEENTRY.b) file. The rest are the test database files needed to run the
program.

Unfortunately, jBASE requires a license and I no longer have such a license, so I cannot truly improve this code and test those improvements, which is unfortunate, since this was written before I was aware of such things as password hashing.
